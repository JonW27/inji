Compile with `make`. It uses cargo now due to my intense need to log the transformation and edge matrices and the fact that they now completely overflow the terminal if just printing to stdout.

Includes:
* Scaling
* Translations
* Rotations
* Bezier Curves
* Hermite Curves
* Circle Drawing
* 3D Boxes
* 3D Spheres
* 3D Toruses
* Polygonal Surfaces (triangles)
* ~~Broken~~ backface culling
* ~~Broken~~ RCS
* Zbuffering
* ~~Broken~~ Scanline Conversion

~~I test-ran it on homer. It worked perfectly fine.~~
