Compile with `make`. It uses cargo now due to my intense need to log the transformation and edge matrices and the fact that they now completely overflow the terminal if just printing to stdout.

Note to self: Never attempt to build anything that requires a decent understanding of math and physics in an extremely strongly typed programming language that you've had little to no experience prior in. 

Includes:
* Scaling
* Translations
* Rotations
* Bezier Curves
* Hermite Curves
* Circle Drawing
* 3D Boxes
* 3D Spheres
* 3D Toruses
* Polygonal Surfaces (triangles)
* ~~Broken~~ backface culling
* Broken RCS

~~I test-ran it on homer. It worked perfectly fine.~~
